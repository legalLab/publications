**DOI:** [10.3389/fcosc.2024.1426488](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcosc.2024.1426488)

This repository contains the occurrence data and the R script used for the analyses performed in this study. All environmental data used in the study can be found in online repositories or published articles, and the methods for accessing and processing them are described in the article's Methods section. We also provide the shapefiles of the study area and the extent of occurrence polygon generated for *Saguinus bicolor*, in addition to the raster files generated with the scenarios (conservative and worst-case) of potential invasion of *Saguinus midas*. The data and maps are user-friendly, openly accessible, and designed to be easily used by decision-makers and conservation managers.
